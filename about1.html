            <b> course observations (the field) </b><br>
            For a semester (15 weeks), I observed a graduate level data science course taught by three different instructors, with varying degrees of dedication to the course. 
            Psuedonyms for these instructors are AB, AP, OP in order of observed leadership in the aforementioned class (however, not yielding credit).
            There were roughly six students that would consistently attend these two-hour seminars taught in the basement of Li-Ka Shing, a building on UC Berkeley dedicated to biomedical and health sciences.
            It was very much necessary for attendees of the class to already have access to such basement, or to, as I did, use the intercom to call an instructor up to pick them up.
            Additionally, while the class was hidden away in the nook of Li-Ka Shing, doors must be propped open in order for the internet connection to reach us.
            The class integrated imaging, git and python into its curriculum through a 1:1 ratio of lecture to practice. Weekly homework and readings are assigned as well. Office hours are also held for this course.
            <p></p>
            <b> instructor interviews (the people) </b><br>
            Throughout the course, I engaged the most with the instructors. I have conducted three individual hour long interviews with the instructors. Two with AB and one with AP.
            During these interviews, I stated my intentions and shared a conversation with the instructors guided by questions I had previously written up prior to the meeting.
