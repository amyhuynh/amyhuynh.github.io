            <b>course observations (the field) </b><br>
For a semester (15 weeks), I observed a graduate level data science course housed by Li Ka Shing, the center for biomedical and health sciences, taught by three different instructors with varying degrees of dedication to the course. The class, taught in the programming language of Python with the aid of iPython notebooks, was held weekly on Friday mornings from 10am to 12pm without fail. The first hour was dedicated to a lecture; the second hour allowed students to put their newly learned skills into practice with the convenience of Python experts (the instructors) at their fingertips for assistance. Most students had no previous exposure to Python, but have interacted with MATLAB. Interestingly enough, this class never secured a CCN (Course Control Number) and therefore is not credit bearing. While taking on the format of a formal course, with required readings and homework exercises, it is important to note that student participation in the class was entirely voluntary and not tied to a grade. Pseudonyms for these instructors are AB, AP, OP in order of observed leadership in the class. 
<p>
<b>a look at the students</b><br>
There were roughly six students that would consistently attend these two-hour creditless seminars taught in the basement of Li-Ka Shing in addition to those that came every two weeks or so. Frequently, women made up at least half of the learners’ population if not more. When discussing this with AB, he attributes this feat to the healthy representation of women in the scientific niche he works in. Students’ ages cluster around mid-20s to early 30s, with the exception of one who can boast of late 30s wisdom. Folks are primarily of Caucasian, East Asian and South Asian descent.
<p>
I would consistently sit in the right corner of the class to observe the teacher-participant interaction. 
<p>
<b>instructor interviews (the people) </b><br>
Throughout the course, I engaged the most with the instructors. I have conducted three individual hour long interviews with the instructors. One structured, another one unstructured with AB (for a total of two) and one with AP that began as structured but ended as unstructured. During these interviews, I stated my intentions and shared a conversation with the instructors guided by questions I had previously written up prior to the meeting. It was in this setting that it became most clear to me what their guiding scientific principle is: the pursuit of good science. Therefore, they feel it is their task to teach the necessary skills for future scientists to accomplish this.
