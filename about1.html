            <b> course observations (the field) </b><br>
            For a semester (15 weeks), I observed a graduate level data science course taught by three different instructors, with varying degrees of dedication to the course. 
            Psuedonyms for these instructors are AB, AP, OP in order of observed leadership in the aforementioned class (however, not yielding credit).
            There were roughly six students that would consistently attend these two-hour seminars taught in the basement of Li-Ka Shing, a building on UC Berkeley dedicated to biomedical and health sciences.
            It was very much necessary for attendees of the class to already have access to such basement, or to, as I did, use the intercom to call an instructor up to pick them up.
            Additionally, while the class was hidden away in the nook of Li-Ka Shing, doors must be propped open in order for the internet connection to reach us.
            The class integrated imaging, git and python into its curriculum through a 1:1 ratio of lecture to practice. Weekly homework and readings are assigned as well. Office hours are also held for this course.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Here is a summary of the course, as offered by the instructors:<br>
            "We aim to teach you how to work with data and with code so that you can get a deeper understanding of how the methods work, how they can fail, how to fix them, and how to develop new methods, if you need them. We aim to teach you to work efficiently, so that you can in due course forget about your tools and think about the ideas. We aim to make things simple, before easy, so that you can reach a stage where things are both simple and easy. We hope that you will come out of this course feeling comfortable working with data from raw images to finished activation maps. We will teach you the standard best practice of how to work with code and data to make your analyses more reliable, easier to share, and easier to reproduce."
            
            
            <p></p>
            <b> instructor interviews (the people) </b><br>
            Throughout the course, I engaged the most with the instructors. I have conducted three individual hour long interviews with the instructors. One structured, another one unstructured with AB (for a total of two) and one with AP that began as structured but ended as unstructured.
            During these interviews, I stated my intentions and shared a conversation with the instructors guided by questions I had previously written up prior to the meeting.
            It was in this setting that it became most clear to me what their guiding principle is, when it comes to science. 
            They are in the pursuit of good science, and want to teach the necessary skills to accomplish such a task to future scientists.
