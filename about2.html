            As the daughter of Vietnam War refugees, I have only recently come to truly deconstruct the impact the war and displacement has had on my parents, including their time in the United States.
            As such, I am grounded in community work and equity + inclusion, in general.
            This is grounded in both my parents' narrative but also my time interning with the <a href = "https://apasd.berkeley.edu"> Asian Pacific American Student Development Office</a> as well as the <a href= "https://mcc.berkeley.edu"> Multicultural Community Center</a>.
            I am also a geek for great design aesthetics + data communication. I am
            currently studying Environmental Economics and Policy.
            Living in a Western society, I see enormous value in data as an impetus for positive change.
            <p></p>
            
            I have also presented my findings at a research symposium. Click below to check it out!<br>
