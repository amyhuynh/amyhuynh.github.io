            As a student who has experienced Cal’s infamously rigorous undergraduate Computer Science courses myself, I am all too painfully aware of the internalized feelings of exclusion and self-doubt of my abilities. Fortunately, due to strong female mentors in my life, I was able to pick myself up and continue pursuing my interest in programming. It is the intersection of education, science and inclusion that interests me. Having served as an AmeriCorps City Year Corps Member at a South Central Los Angeles Middle School, I am aware of the challenges of building an inclusive curriculum + environment but am also conscious of an inclusive environment’s ability to empower young folks. Therefore, this study aims to understand the “best practices” of cultivating a more inclusive scientific learning environment. It is my wish that these findings are used to promote a curriculum that invites all students to challenge themselves through an environment that acknowledges all students’ needs in the classroom.

            I have also presented my findings of what motivates an inclusive scientific classroom at a research symposium. Click below to view the presentation.<br>
