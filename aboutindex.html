            This ethnographic research was conceived through a larger reflection on pedagogical (teaching-learning) methodology in various data-driven educational environments with a specific focus on the processes of inclusion and exclusion. 

Dialogue on how to better engage students in science education is certainly not <a href = "https://www.math.upenn.edu/~pemantle/active-papers/springer-stanne-donovan.pdf">new</a> but is gaining momentum as <a href= "http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14588/nsf14588.htm">federal science agencies</a> work to gain insight on the topic. Coupled with the emerging popularity of interdisciplinary fields (i.e., <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.05570.pdf">Data Science</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-xuSSYV-c09zLZDINCO-WolPEQP8znQ2A_hyYNHxdlU/edit#heading=h.sylao9ssuxc3">Digital Humanities</a>) 
there has been increased push for inclusion both in term of student identity and disciplinary backgrounds.

The objective of this research is to document motivations of 
inclusionary acts and key practices that contribute to an inclusive environment in a data science classroom. 
Constant body of literature suggests that <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/designteach/teach/learningenvironment.html">classroom climate</a>
 is key in student success, that “<a href="http://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/diversity/">there are no universal solutions or specific rules for responding to ethnic, gender, and cultural diversity in the classroom…</a>” but 
 <a href="http://www.fasebj.org/content/28/1_Supplement/618.35">careful observations</a> have been conducted in different disciplines (such as <a href="https://ucbfodaap.wordpress.com/tag/inclusive-archaeology/">archeology</a> and <a href="http://food.berkeley.edu/equity-and-inclusion/"> food systems</a>), 
 and <a href="http://www.crlt.umich.edu/multicultural-teaching/inclusive-teaching-strategies">strategies</a> do exists.

            <div class = "Kind">COMMON GOOD?</div>
                        <div class = "Choice">
                            Philosophy on the necessity of furthering common good is grounded in the ages of Plato and Aristotle. 
Today, contemporary ethicist, John Rawls, defines the notion of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scu.edu%2Fethics%2Fpracticing%2Fdecision%2Fcommongood.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGqJuvqPDDCClLZrJaAvVFtsmVtMA">common good</a> 
to be "certain general conditions that are...equally to everyone's advantage." It is thought that this conception can be conceived through increasing the supply of 
“<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.people.fas.harvard.edu%2F~korsgaar%2FFreeman.CMK.Rawls.EE2.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHNnyb4EhjEwHqVewrYP80ZDoK7vQ">primary goods</a>”, 
things required for a good life such as opportunity, liberty, respect, right, etc. 
These primary goods are the requirements for social mobility. 
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=GqaeBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA133&lpg=PA133&dq=john+rawls+certain+general+conditions+that+are...equally+to+everyone%27s+advantage&source=bl&ots=_udz3cksPP&sig=L47loH2CuKmdZaJcJfQDOr-G-0w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qW-EVajnB8jWoASj17DICw&ved=0CEkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=john%20rawls%20certain%20general%20conditions%20that%20are...equally%20to%20everyone%27s%20advantage&f=false">Elena Druica</a> acknowledges this when pointing out common good as “the sum of those conditions of social life which allows social groups and their individual members relatively thorough and ready access to their own fulfillment.” For this to take place, there needs to be inclusionary action for people of all different walks of life to feel valued and welcomed into their field of interest. Different perspectives will push for the design of products, ideas and policies that will be more empathetic to a broader spectrum of society.
It is for this very reason that this project investigates the motivations behind inclusionary efforts in the classroom, the foundational access point to a specific career field.
