            <b>what is social good?</b><br>
            Contemporary ethicist, John Rawls, defines it to be "certain general conditions that are...equally to everyone's advantage."<br>
            This is inherently releated to the concept of social justice which, as defined by John T. Jost and Aaron C. Kay can be summed up by three basic conditions: "1. benefits and burdens in society are dispersed in accordance with some allocation principle (or set of principles); 2. procedures, norms, and rules that govern political and other forms of decision making preserve the basic rights, liberties, and entitlements of individuals and groups; and 3. human beings are treated with dignity and respect not only by authorities but also by other relevant social actors, including fellow citizens."<br>
            <br>
            <b>what is good science?</b><br>
            Good science is the pursuit of the truth.
            Good science understands the data that is being inputted into the experiment, is not <a href = "http://newsroom.unsw.edu.au/news/science/what-good-science"><font color="#a0a0a1"> pressured by the need to publish</font></a>, follows the scientific method, is peer-reviewed + reproducible.
            <br>
            <b> the site of study </b>
            Over the course of a semester (15 weeks), I have observed a graduate level data science course held in Li-Ka Shing.

                This ethnographic study is a part of the Berkeley Institue of Data Science (BIDS) as well as a larger initiative to make data science more accessible to undergraduates.<br>
                Since there are no explicit undergraduate classes on data science, this study observes a course that boasted of data science pedagogy to better understand the makings of
                an effective + inclusive curriculum to further inform the undergraduate initiative.
