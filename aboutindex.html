            <div class = "Choice">
                This ethnographic study is a part of the Berkeley Institue of Data Science (BIDS) as well as a larger initiative to make data science more accessible to undergraduates.<br>
                Since there are no explicit undergraduate classes on data science, this study observes a course that boasted of data science pedagogy to better understand the makings of
                an effective + inclusive curriculum to further inform the undergraduate initiative.

            "Scientific claims making, ethnographers have shown, is powerful. That is, the imaginary has consequences for peopleâ€™s lives, for institutional investments, for the economy, and for the way we think about and treat the ecologies that we need to thrive. Nowhere is this more true than for race and racial inequity. <br>
            <br>
            The stakes for me then, as now, are to understand power and privilege through the knowledge making practices that we call technoscientific. This returns me to my original interest in anthropology, its commitment to human equality, its potential to place a wedge in ideological frameworks that perpetuate inequities.
