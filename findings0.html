            <b> in the beginning...</b><br>
            It was very easy to feel like an outsider as I felt like I didn't have the knowledge that everyone else had to keep up.
            While I am taking computer science courses, the students were trained in higher level mathematics, physics and other hard sciences that I had
            very little exposure to. While I felt like the instructors meant well and very much did make it clear that they were there to help,
            the class was often quiet as the students typed away on their keyboards on their practice problems. As the problems didn't relate directly
            with me, as they did for the other students (providing pragmatic use), I often stopped attempting the course's problem set to instead,
            observe.<br>
            I do not think I gained the trust of the instructors until I went to my first office hours. This showed I cared about the project, I think.
            <br><br>
            It was interesting to me that I, even as an outsider, whose place in the class is inconsequential, fell victim to fearing the knowledge facade
            that I believed I could not keep up.
