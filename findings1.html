            Having spent time studying an inclusive data science curriculum, I've observed that some factors play a massive role in building such an environment...<br>
            <br>
            <b>classroom size</b>: From my observations, small sized classrooms (coupled with experience in a large undergraduate course with approximately 1,000 students as well as an optional academic support discussion guided by a CS Mentor with four other students) provided students the space to allow questions to be asked without feeling like they were taking up too much space. The material is better able to be crafted to the students’ interests -- this special attention goes a long way. It helps retain learners.<br>
            <b>participant skill level</b>: If the group is not separated based on skill level -- which is encouraged, as beginners in a “walking” group will be more apt to help one another while advanced learners can speed ahead without worrying about zooming far too ahead of the beginners. However, this goes back to point one -- if the classroom size is small enough (as the observed course was), then it is unnecessary to categorize the students. But it is important to be inclusive of all academic/skill backgrounds that the learners come from.<br>
            <b>participation/teamwork</b>: There is increased accountability when students work together and feel like they are also expected to have answers to push the learning of their peers. This was clear during the few times a student in the class asked another student for help -- the other student had more incentive to make sense of the problem they were tackling and, in fact, both embark down a road of collaboration.<br>
            <b>curriculum pace</b>: It is important that the course is structured in a way that is accessible to learners that do not have the technical acuity to grasp concepts as quickly as those with previous exposure. It was clear in student feedback that learners found the slow buildup of material (from learning how to use iPython Notebooks to Python basics to understanding Git to be incredibly accessible and useful.<br>
            and last, but certainly not least, <b>instructor commitment</b>: When an instructor pours a respectable amount of commitment into a course and makes it clear that he/she cares about their students’ success, it makes a perceivable difference in the learning environment. There is greater accountability to attempting the work -- as if the student is <i>failing the teacher</i> and not just the course when there is a lack of effort.<br>
