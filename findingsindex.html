            <div class="Choice">Most notable, or interesting, that was found during this study is that <b> inclusion is not always motivated by a profound commitment to equity, but can be a fringe consequence of a devotion to another value (i.e., good science)</b>.
            “We will teach you the standard best practice of how to work with code and data to make your analyses more reliable, easier to share, and easier to reproduce," is how AB likes to look at the motivation for his course.
            Inherently, AB is pushing back against the onslaught of sloppy publications that have been released in pursuit of a grant and is, instead,
            promoting an alternative to analyzing one's information - to avoid such sloppiness and to encourage much greater understanding of one's work.
            <p></p>
            AB makes a clear point to explain that the facade of knowledge plays a large role in this field.<br>
            “One of the advantages that I have is that I’m old. When I was younger I felt much more anxious about how I appeared. As you’re older you realize how foolish that is,” AB tells me, “You also have a career so you don’t have to pretend to be clever so you can get a job.”
            <br>
            AB, in the pursuit of honest good science, began this program in the hopes that “machine learning will help perceive accuracy” and thus really push scientists to question what “knowing” and “fact” truly mean in the scope of research. Honest good science, according to Matt, is an science of accuracy that is not tainted by the desire to get published quickly in order to gain grants from various organizations. He pushes against the idea that science and programming are incompatible and in fact, alluded to the idea that one cannot do proper science without proper programming
            <br>
            Therefore, the class teaches what is minimally necessary for neuroscientists to produce good research.The retention of consistent students, as in those that show up weekly, is currently at 70% (this is calculated from my own weekly observations of who physically shows up to class). Some students come bi-weekly, others drop by. Admittedly, this is impressive for an entirely optional, but truly organic, teaching model and reflects AB’s willingness and commitment to serving his students. I can see it humbling AB when he must break down complex ideas that must, at this point, seem simple enough for him to his students. Yet he is entirely eager for this process. Students gage this and, I believe, are also excited for this class. In its practicality, he has won fans. Students are entirely punctual, for the most part. This only goes to show that they take both AB and this class seriously. While there is not much chattering going on during the class -- for they truly value learning the basics of Python -- there is clear respect for the teaching team and their unorthodox teaching-learning brainchild.
