            â€œWe will teach you the standard best practice of how to work with code and data to make your analyses more reliable, easier to share, and easier to reproduce," is how AB likes to look at the motivation for his course.
            Inherently, AB is pushing back against the onslaught of sloppy publications that have been released in pursuit of a grant and is, instead,
            promoting an alternative to analyzing one's information - to avoid such sloppiness and to encourage much greater understanding of one's work.
