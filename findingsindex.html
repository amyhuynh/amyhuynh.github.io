                <b>pedagogy</b><br>
The class focuses on analyzing and pulling visualizations from raw (big) data. Therefore, it integrates imaging, git and python into its curriculum through a 1:1 ratio of lecture to practice. Weekly homework and readings are assigned as well. Office hours are also held for this course. <br><br>
Here is a summary of the course, as offered by the instructors:<br>
"We aim to teach you how to work with data and with code so that you can get a deeper understanding of how the methods work, how they can fail, how to fix them, and how to develop new methods, if you need them. We aim to teach you to work efficiently, so that you can in due course forget about your tools and think about the ideas. We aim to make things simple, before easy, so that you can reach a stage where things are both simple and easy. We hope that you will come out of this course feeling comfortable working with data from raw images to finished activation maps. We will teach you the standard best practice of how to work with code and data to make your analyses more reliable, easier to share, and easier to reproduce."<br><br>
This piece of feedback perfectly illustrates my experience in the course, as well: “It starts with raw data, and works through every step of preprocessing, leaving no detail uncovered. The instructors emphasize the logic of each step, something often overlooked by people who use “point and click,” black-box software packages.”<p>

<b>overall…</b><br>
Most notable, or interesting, that was found during this study is that <b>inclusion is not always motivated singularly by profound commitment to equity, but can also be a fringe consequence of a devotion to another value (i.e., good science)</b>. “We will teach you the standard best practice of how to work with code and data to make your analyses more reliable, easier to share, and easier to reproduce," is how AB likes to look at the motivation for his course. Inherently, AB is pushing back against the onslaught of sloppy publications that have been released in pursuit of a grant funding and is, instead, promoting an alternative to analyzing one's information - to avoid such sloppiness and to encourage much greater understanding of one's work.<br>
The inclusionary aspect of this class comes from the teaching staff’s undeniable commitment to exemplifying and continuously emphasizing that <i>no one knows everything</i>. For example, when a question is asked that AB is unable to answer -- he will make it clear that he has not a clue, but will work with you to find a satisfying answer. Additionally, during the work hour, the teaching staff walks around the room to assist struggling students. Since no one particularly enjoys self-identifying as struggling, AB will go the extra mile and even ask his students if he may help them answer any particular question. It is through accommodating students of all skill levels with this amount of care that has led to such an environment. <br>
To the prior point, AB makes a clear point to explain that the facade of knowledge plays a large role in this field.<br>
“One of the advantages that I have is that I’m old. When I was younger I felt much more anxious about how I appeared. As you’re older you realize how foolish that is,” AB tells me, “You also have a career so you don’t have to pretend to be clever so you can get a job.” <br>
AB, in the pursuit of honest good science, began this program in the hopes that “machine learning will help perceive accuracy” and thus really push scientists to question what “knowing” and “fact” truly mean in the scope of research. Honest good science, according to Matt, is an science of accuracy that is not tainted by the desire to get published quickly in order to gain grants from various organizations. He pushes against the idea that science and programming are incompatible and in fact, alluded to the idea that one cannot do proper science without proper programming.<br>
Therefore, the class teaches what is minimally necessary for neuroscientists to produce good research.The retention of consistent students, as in those that show up weekly, is currently at 70%. Some students come bi-weekly, others drop by. Admittedly, this is impressive for an entirely optional, but truly organic, teaching model and reflects AB’s willingness and commitment to serving his students. I can see it humbling AB when he must break down complex ideas that must, at this point, seem simple enough for him to his students. Yet he is entirely eager for this process. Students gage this and, I believe, are also excited for this class. In its practicality, he has won fans. Students are entirely punctual, for the most part. This only goes to show that they take both AB and this class seriously. While there is not much chattering going on during the class -- for they truly value learning the basics of Python -- there is clear respect for the teaching team and their unorthodox teaching-learning brainchild.
