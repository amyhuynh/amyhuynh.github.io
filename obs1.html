            At 10:05am outside of Li-Ka Shing, I would use the intercom to inform an instructor of my arrival. At 10:10am, an instructor would emerge from the staircases to permit me entrance to the division of Li-Ka Shing that houses the classroom the course utilizes. At 10:15am, I would settle down in a seat in the corner of the classroom after navigating a number of turns and doorway entries. At 10:16am, I would download the day’s iPython Notebook to follow along the day’s topic -- a continuation of Program Composition Notation (PCN) analysis. At 10:25am, I am thoroughly confused despite my background in Python and Java -- my lack of thorough statistics training seems to be the cause of the confusion. At 10:30am, I ask a student nearby if they understand what is going on and she admits she’s learned about PCN before but keeps a checklist of steps to cycle through -- meaning she doesn’t fully understand the concept. At 10:40am, there seems to be a small conflict between the teaching staff in how to breakdown the conceptual image behind this material. At 11:01am, the instructors share a friendly debate on the differences in teaching and the impact of the various explanations at the whiteboard while students open up their exercises. At 12pm, students pack up their material to leave and thank the instructors.
