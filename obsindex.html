<b>the built environment</b><br>
Attendees Students - primarily of the same discipline as the main instructor - already have access to the basement department and mustnâ€™t, as I did, use the intercom to notify an instructor up and request an escort to the classroom. This was an obstacle for me each week as I had to wait to be fetched by someone to attend the class. Upon my first visit to the classroom, I felt as if AB were leading me down an intricate labyrith pathway that eventually let out to a small underground space sparsely populated by folks each with a laptop propped up in front of them. The semi-lit nature of the room, the projector and the unfinished walls lent themselves to the early 2000s hacker-like atmosphere. People gathered due to a similar interest (desire to learn a new tool) but there was no budget to adequately support this effort, even at an institution such as UC Berkeley. Case in point: The class was hidden away in the nook of Li-Ka Shing, classroom doors must be propped open in order for the internet connection to reach us. This was unexpected, as I figured graduate initiatives to be well-funded, especially an initiative such as this -- with the depth of intentional planning and an egalitarian goal to teach this particular branch of data science to any student.
